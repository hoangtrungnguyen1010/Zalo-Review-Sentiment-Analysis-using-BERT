# Zalo-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT
The Zalo Review Sentiment Analysis project aims to classify the sentiment of user reviews from the Zalo platform using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It leverages the power of BERT, a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model, to understand the sentiment expressed in textual reviews and predict whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

The project utilizes the Zalo dataset, which consists of a collection of user reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. By fine-tuning the BERT model on this dataset, the project builds a sentiment classification model that can automatically analyze and categorize user reviews based on their sentiment.

The project involves data preprocessing, tokenization using the BERT tokenizer, model training, and evaluation. It utilizes the Transformers library by Hugging Face for BERT model implementation and the PyTorch deep learning framework. The trained model can be used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews, providing valuable insights for businesses and organizations leveraging the Zalo platform.

With the Zalo Review Sentiment Analysis project, users can gain a better understanding of the sentiment expressed in Zalo reviews, allowing them to extract actionable insights, monitor customer satisfaction, and make informed business decisions based on user feedback.
